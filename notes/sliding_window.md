# Sliding Window Strategy

This usually reduces a brute force approach's runtime of `O(n^2)` to `O(n)` when
working on a list-like data structure.

## Fixed Window

Some problems deal with fixed windows of length `k`.

## Dynamic Window

Other problems want to find the minimum or maximum length of elements in the list
that meet a certain criterion. Thus, the window may grow or shrink.
